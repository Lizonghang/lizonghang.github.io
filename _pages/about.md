Hi! I am Zonghang Li, a Ph.D. graduate from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, advised by Prof. [Hongfang Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GmEdMqwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018) from UESTC. I visited **University of Oxford** in 2018, **Peng Cheng Laboratory** in 2020 advised by Prof. [Zenglin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gF0H9nEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)** in 2021 advised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Han Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Now, I am doing postdoc research at **MBZUAI** with Prof. [Mohsen Guizani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RigrYkcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Qirong Ho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tR3AZbwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research interests are mainly in **Distributed AI Systems**, including:
  - Optimizations for Large Model Training & Inference
  - Computer Network for Distributed ML Systems
  - Efficient and Robust Federated Learning

Now, I have published more than 30 papers in top-tier journals including IEEE/ACM TON, IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, IEEE JSAC, IEEE COMST, IEEE Wire. Comm., IEEE TCC, IEEE TNSM, etc. I also contributed to a [work](https://github.com/Lizonghang/KlonetAI) adopted by a paper on NSDI 2024. Additionally, I obtained 6 CN Patents and authored one book titled "[Geo-distributed Machine Learning: Enabling Integration of Intelligence on Multiple Clouds](https://www.phei.com.cn/module/goods/wssd_content.jsp?bookid=61965)". My work [GeoMX](https://github.com/INET-RC/GeoMX) won the **Future Network Leading Innovative Scientific and Technological Achievement Award** of China Institute of Communications in 2021, and our papers won the **2023 Best Paper Award of Guangdong Computer Society**, **2023 Best Paper Award of IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing**, and **Best Paper Award of IWCMC 2025**. I serve as an assistant area editor in IEEE IoT-J, an assistant editor in IEEE COMST and IEEE Network, an assistant guest editor in IEEE VTM, IEEE IoTM, and a TPC member in HPCC 2021, WCNC 2022-2023, and iThings 2023.
