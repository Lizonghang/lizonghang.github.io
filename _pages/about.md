Hi! I am Zonghang Li, a Ph.D. graduate from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, advised by Prof. [Hongfang Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GmEdMqwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018) from UESTC. I visited **University of Oxford** in 2018, **Peng Cheng Laboratory** in 2020 advised by Prof. [Zenglin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gF0H9nEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)** in 2021 advised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Han Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My research interests are mainly in **Distributed AI Systems, Algorithms, and Applications**, including:
  - Optimizations for Large Model Training & Inference
  - Computer Network for Distributed ML Systems
  - Efficient and Robust Federated Learning

I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Models, and other fantastic technologies. 

Now, I have published more than 20 academic papers in top-tier journals including **IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, IEEE JSAC, IEEE COMST**, IEEE Wire. Comm., IEEE TCC, IEEE TNSM, IEEE Network, and IEEE IoT-J. (And one paper during 2nd review process in **IEEE TON** with positive comments.) I also contributed to a work presented on **[NSDI 2024](https://github.com/Lizonghang/KlonetAI)**. In addition, I obtained 6 CN Patents and authored **one book titled "[Geo-distributed Machine Learning: Enabling Integration of Intelligence on Multiple Clouds](https://www.phei.com.cn/module/goods/wssd_content.jsp?bookid=61965)"**. My work **[GeoMX](https://github.com/INET-RC/GeoMX)** won the **Future Network Leading Innovative Scientific and Technological Achievement Award of China Institute of Communications** in 2021, and one paper won the **Best Paper Award in Guangdong Computer Society** in 2023. I serve as an assistant area editor in IEEE IoT-J, an assistant editor in IEEE COMST and IEEE Network, and a TPC member in HPCC 2021, WCNC 2022-2023, and iThings 2023. I also serve as a reviewer in IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TSC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TVT, IEEE TCCN, IEEE COMST, IEEE Network, IEEE IoT-J, J-STSP, and Cluster Computing. 

Recently, I was fascinated by the advances of large models and am learning new things. **I am looking for a postdoc position in the field of large model systems and applications**. If you are interested in me, contact me (Email: lizhuestc@gmail.com)! :sparkles: :smile:
